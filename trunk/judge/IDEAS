From dgott: Abstract away jail, have a NakedJudge as well as a XenJudge, 
make the interface sufficiently general that a UMLJudge can be plugged 
in without much reworking of the interface.

Maybe: Use python module difflib for whitespace insensitive (presentation 
error) diffing.  It seems cleaner to call a module than shell out to 
diff -b.
