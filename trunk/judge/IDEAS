From dgott: Abstract away jail, have a NakedJudge as well as a XenJudge, 
make the interface sufficiently general that a UMLJudge can be plugged 
in without much reworking of the interface.

Maybe: Use python module difflib for whitespace insensitive (presentation 
error) diffing.  It seems cleaner to call a module than shell out to 
diff -b.

How to write specific judgers?
Option 1, implement some python func/class to do judging
   Pros:  Nice integration with the rest of the code, can do things like 
        catching exceptions, etc
   Cons:  The judger must be written in Python, might not be right for the
        general community.

Option 2: implement a program that reads program output from stdin and 
          returns true iff the program was correct
   Pros: More unixy, can write judge in any lang
   Cons: A bit more unwieldy.
