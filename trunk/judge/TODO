Split NakedJudge into components.  It has currently has two distinct and 
separable jobs, one is to set up an environment and execute code, which might 
be named the Executor infuture versions, the other is two determine of the
job actually did what it was supposed to, which itself should be called the
Judger.

Support running the judger in chroot'ed environment (or split this code into a 
new Executor?).  This has it's owndifficulties, since running a chrooted 
binary requires that all its dynamic library dependencies are also included 
in the chrooted directory.  There is also the problem that some programs 
require files at runtine, which are not easily determined with automatically.
